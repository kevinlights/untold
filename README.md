# Untold

_Untold_ was my entry to the nineteenth Godot Wild Jam.

## What can I do with this?

The game code is licensed under GNU GPLv3. The assets, on the other hand, are copyrighted.

## A little note...

This game's code is a bit of a mess. I spent a lot of my time during the jam butting heads with some indecipherable bugs, and ended up having to cut quite a few intended features. Additionally, the code itself, and the design choices behind it, are questionable. I would not advise using this project as a reference for your own learning.
